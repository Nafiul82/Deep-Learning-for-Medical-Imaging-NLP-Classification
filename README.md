# Deep-Learning-for-Medical-Imaging-NLP-Classification

This project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify MRI brain scans into three categories:

Glioma Tumour

Pituitary Tumour

No Tumour

The goal is to support early diagnosis by automating image-based tumour detection, reducing reliance on manual interpretation.

The final model achieved 90%+ accuracy on the test dataset, meeting the target requirement for successful classification.

Evaluation metrics include:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score
